- What is your favorite programming language? Why?

My favorite programming language is python due to the simple functionality and various packages I can use such as pandas and numpy. It is not syntax heavy like java or other object oriented programming languages and it is more user friendly. There is also a lot you can do with it for data analytics and I am excited to learn more.

- Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with? 

My favorite language is not the one I am most experienced with. I am most experienced with java, but after starting to learn python I am starting to like python more and more over java.
